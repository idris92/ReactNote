The Effect hook (useEffect) give the ability to perform side on a functional componenets
e.g subscription,data fetching etc. useEffect serve the same purpose as componentDidMount,
componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount in React classes.

To use useEffect in react project, we import it from react:

import {useEffect} from 'react';

Note: Effect are declared inside the components so they can have access to its props and state.

syntax:
 useEffect(()=>{
     //first section
     render()=>{
         //second section
     }
 }, [])


React run the effect at the first section any time the page is load up which work as 
componentDidMount in class components.
React run the effect at the second section when the page unmount(close/not rendered)
work as a componentWillUnmount in class components.
The last part of the useEffect is the square bracket which serves as a dependency

Note: 

When the dependency is not specified the effect will only run once.
When the dependency is specified the effect will run  the first time and anytime there is an update to that dependency.
When there is no bracket, the useEffect will rerender everytime.
