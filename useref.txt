useRef Hooks: this hooks give us the ability to manipulate the DOM, remember the 
DOM manipulation in javascript: document.querySelector, document.getElementById
getElementByClassName etc useRef also help get the reference of an element which
can be store in a variable, and with this you  apply it to other element 
or make changes to the  current element properties e.g you can change the color of the
element, the style etc.
Note: 1. The main use of useRef is to store the reference of an element, not the value.
To store the value you use UseState hooks.
2. No matter the changes made with useRef, your DOM will never re-render, useState re-render
the DOM element.
3. You dont create an initialValue for a useRef, useRef return a mutable object
and the object have a .current property, its useState that takes in string,
number, object, array etc as initialValue.

Things to always remember: 
1. useRef is an object and the object has a .current property
2. useRef doesnt re-render the DOM element no matter the time its manipulated


Although you can use useRef to store value but that isnt what its design for,
useState can be used to store value.

code:

import {useRef} from 'react'


const app=()=> {
  const inputElement = useRef();
  const onButtonClick = () => {
    console.log(input.current);
    inputElement.current.style.width="400px";
  };
  return (
    <>
      <input ref={inputElement} type="text" style={{width:"100px"}}/>
      <button onClick={onButtonClick}>Focus the input</button>
    </>
  );
}


1. import {useRef} from 'react' : This is line is used to import useRef hook from react;
2. const inputElement = useRef(); : We are assigning the useRef function return object to a constant inputElement 
3. onButtonClick is an arrow function which is triggered by the button click
4. console.log(input.current); : this will output the element with the reference,
output: <input type="text" style={{width:"100px"}} /> because this is the element with the ref.
5. inputEl.current.style.width="400px"; This will change the width of the input box from 100px to 400px
